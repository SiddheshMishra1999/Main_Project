# Main_Project

/groups/k/kj_comp353_1       This directory is where you should cd into
                                 and use while working on the project.
                                 It is *NOT* available on the web server!
				(Not needed very much, since we use github)


/www/groups/k/kj_comp353_1   	This is the directory where you should place
                                 *ALL* the files to be viewable on the web.
